## üåü How to Run the Project

To explore the site, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download**: Grab the ZIP folder from our submission or clone the repo.
2. **Run via Web Server**: Due to the use of `fetch()` for loading product data (e.g., `products.json`), this project **must be served via a web server**. You can:
   - Use a local server like `Live Server` in VS Code.
   - Run `python -m http.server` in the project directory and access it at `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Deploy it to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages doesn‚Äôt fully work due to `fetch()` restrictions).
3. **Start Here**: Open `index.html` in Chrome to land on the login page.
